I was supposed to be asleep\nabout an hour ago. I think it's partially nerves and partially my desire to try\nto finish a little bit more of what will probably be a decent text editor once\nI'm done with it.\nI don't have anything cool or technical to say here honestly. I'm treating this\npost a little bit more like a journal than anything, so don't waste your time if\nyou're not interested in it.\nAlso, this is really not a well thought out post. This is more for me than you\nand the odds that it reads like a brain dump rather than an essay seem to be\nvery much in favour.\nI guess I'm feeling anxious. Last academic term didn't go as well as I hoped.\nThere were a lot of personal complications that I may choose to share in the\nfuture. I think we all have to eventually get to a place where we at least feel\nsomewhat in control of what we're doing. I want to at least. I kind of had this\nfeeling in 1B that my life was running me and not the other way around. It was\nplainly something that was unproductive and unhealthy for me.\nI guess I'm really not sure what to do now. I've had a full year of university\nunder my belt and yet I don't feel like I really know what I'm doing.\nAdmittedly, I'm sure in some sense it comes down to lack of maturity and\ndiscipline. I make no claim to be right in having this feeling or that it is\njustified by my circumstances. I only mean to express that I do feel unsure of\nspecifically how to make myself the better version of who I can be.\nA schedule is a big part of it I think? It's something I always avoid but maybe\nthis is the term that I can put more focus into it. I just have difficulty\nstaying on track with things. I drop them too early and I need to figure out how\nto design systems to make it easier to stay with them. Hopefully a fast computer\nand good cross platform workflow helps to start but ultimately I think\ndiscipline is at stake.\nI'm scared. I'm honestly pretty scared.\nAt the same time, I have hope. I'm not completely without any sort of hope for\nthis term and my experience in it. Maybe something good will come out of this\ntransformative part of my life.\nThe road certainly doesn't feel amazing once you're walking on it, but it looks\ninspiring at the beginning and impressive at the end.\nGood night - I'll write some more in 2A.\nAiden\n","id":"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/2a-and-hope/","title":"2A and Hope"},"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/coop-update/":{"body":"Long time no chat! Finals season is almost done for me. Just two more exams\nand I'll be able to say I'm all done. I can't say I'm super fond of having to\nwork through finals all that much\nUnfortunately, the co-op opportunity that I talked about having in a prior\npost has fallen through. I won't get into the specifics, but it was not a\ngood fit for either of us.\nAs a result, I applied for the Recurse Center and got\nin! I'm beyond excited about it and I've also lined up a local startup to\nwork for during this time. I'm very pleased to have avoided the issue of\nemployment this term, as it seems to be the trend to not have any good job.\nIn other news, I've got a blog post in the workings about the CHICKEN Scheme\nCompiler. My plan so far for my time at the Recurse Center is to write a\ncompiler of my own, possibly using Scheme 5 (do people call it that?) as a\ntarget.\nAlso, I started a chain on Mastodon asking Matt\nGodbolt for books on compilers and interpreter design. It has some good picks\nout of it. I'll summarize them below for posterity!\n\nModen Compiler Construction in ML by Andrew W. Appel\nCompilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and\nUllman\nCrafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom\nEssentials of Compilation (Python Edition) by Jeremy G. Siek\nEngineering a Compiler by Cooper and Torczon\n\nNot technically a compiler book, but very cool:\n\nPrinciples of Program Analysis by Nielson, Nielson, and Hankin\n\nSome academic resources listed too:\n\nStanford's \"CS143 Compilers\" (by Alex Aiken) on Coursera\nCornell's CS612\n\nThank you to Matthew Godbolt, David Beazley, CF Bolz-Tereick, Scott Graham,\nRon Gilbert, sandmage, mnml mnl, Marco, and SteeleDynamics.\n","id":"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/coop-update/","title":"Summer '23 Coop Update"},"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/coop3/":{"body":"Today I got matched with my third co-op position!

I'll have to learn more about Resnet and YOLO!\nAs for this blog, I expect to be able to write a little bit more now that\nI have one less thing to worry about. I've been doing some contributions to\na class autograder, which has been kind of neat. I started poking around with\nusing Rust to write an LLVM backed Scheme 5 compiler.

This leads to school projects taking up\nfar too much time for what is reasonable. While I write this, a project using\ntries is calling my name.\nI honestly don't have anything terribly cool to say.

I'm not\nsure why you would consider me a lawyer, but unfortunately I am not.\n\nA week ago I had a discussion about the ethics and reasons for why an undergraduate\nstudent in certain engineering programs might choose to illegally (in Ontario) use the\ntitle \"Engineer\", in the event that it was given to them by an employer\nduring on of their co-ops.\nThe specific act that makes this illegal in Ontario is called the\nProfessional Engineering Act, which created Professional Engineers\nOntario and gave it the power and legal ability to impose a fine on those\nwho misrepresent themselves as professional engineers.\nThe relevant section for this discussion is below:\n\n\n\nEvery person who is not a holder of a licence or a temporary licence and who,\n\n\nuses the title “professional engineer” or “ingénieur” or an abbreviation\nor variation thereof as an occupational or business designation;\n\nuses the title “engineer” or an abbreviation of that title\nin a manner that will lead to the belief that the person may engage\nin the practice of professional engineering;\n\n\n\nuses a term, title or description that will lead to the belief\nthat the person may engage in the practice of professional engineering; or\n\n\nuses a seal that will lead to the belief that the person is a\nprofessional engineer,\n\n\n\n\nis guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable for the first offence to a\nfine of not more than $10,000 and for each subsequent offence to a fine of\nnot more than $25,000.\nR.S.O. 1990, c. P.28, s. 40 (2); 2001, c. 9, Sched. B, s. 11 (59).\n\nAt face value, the act prohibits using the title \"engineer\" in a way that leads\nto the belief that the person using it is a professional engineer.\nTo be certain we understand what a professional engineer is, let's have a look in\nthe definitions section of the act.\n\n“practice of professional engineering” means any act of planning, designing,\ncomposing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising that\nrequires the application of engineering principles and concerns the\nsafeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public\nwelfare or the environment, or the managing of any such act; (“exercice de\nla profession d’ingénieur”)\n\nIt's pretty clear to see that this applies pretty generally to most, if not all,\nroles that we traditionally call engineering. You can argue for software engineering\nand disciplines that don't directly deal with something that's obviously tangible\nto be considered perhaps \"not engineering\", but I see it as having a pretty sizeable\nimpact on humanity.\nI think the reason we classically consider civil engineering or environmental\nengineering as being professional engineering comes down to the fact that the\nlargest clients for both are, in some structure, either the government\nitself, or companies under very strong supervision by the government.\nWhy are we so fussy about engineering being accredited?\nThe classic touchstone for this is the Quebec Bridge collapse, occuring in August\n29th of 1907 and then September 11th of 1916. To my knowledge, and according to this\narticle, it remains the most deadly (in terms of casualties) bridge collapse\nin Canadian history. The reason for the collapse comes down to the dead load applied\non the structure. For those not in the know, the dead load refers to the latent weight\nof a structure that it has and addition weights from things that will not change over\ntime. The main dead load for this bridge was its own weight, but additional things like\ndecorations or lights also count as a dead load.\nI'm not studying a very physical engineering subdiscipline, so admittedly I can't\noffer too much comment about the specifics of collapse, but the liability issue\ncomes down to the fact that calculations done by the initial engineering team weren't\nchecked during construction and were only valid for a smaller dead load.\nThe result of this was that a Royal Commission by the federal government that found\nthat two engineers, Theodore Cooper and Peter L. Szlapka, were those guilty of\nthe bridge failure. From what is understood, neither of them faced any penalties.\n\nYour commisioners find:\n(a) The collapse of the Quebec bridge resulted from the faiure of the lower\nchords in the anchor arm near the main pier. The failure of these chords was\ndue to their defective design.\n(b) The stresses that caused the failure were not due to abnormal weather\nconditions or accident, but were such as might be expected in the regular\ncourse of erection.\n(c) The design of the chords that failed was made by Mr. P. L. Szlapka, the\ndesigning engineer of the Phoenix Bridge Company.\n(d) The design was examined and officially approved by Mr. Theodore Cooper,\nconsulting engineer of the Quebec Bridge and Railway Company.\n(e) The failure cannot be attributed directly to any cuase other than errors\nin judgement on the part of these two engineers.\n\nThere is more on file, but this is really all the essentially information found inside\nthe conclusions to the Royal Commission. In essence, it marked a moment where the oversight\nof engineers lacked\nWe can conclude that it is important to actually have a licensing mechanism for\nengineers and ensure that we treat it as a generally licensed profession. Now, abstractly\nwe would really wish that everyone who works on dangerous things would be\nlicensed, but that isn't the case. Understandably, it's not often terribly profitable\nto have red tape when you are used to having none. For example, it would arguably\nbe important for those working at large hedge funds, banks, and other financial\norganizations to take an oath to avoid causing harm as a result of their decisions.\nWe know this is not the case at all. Now, you can argue with me on this point, but\nthe actions taken by those at Lehman Brothers that lead up to the\n2008 financial crash, were most certainly not ones that were directly aiming for a\ngeneral wellbeing of people.\nIt's also clear that accredited people can and have been inept at their job. Medical\ndoctors go through an unpleasant amount of schooling and accreditation, all for some\nof them to end up with malpractice charges.\nIn a general case, we can agree that accreditation and making ethical oaths is a\ngenerally good thing for public wellbeing, but it isn't a silver bullet.\nOn the importance of words\nWe use words every day to communicate different things and with varying\ndegrees. No one, including me, is ever going to really be able to agree on\nwhat is an okay usage of it. For some people, using crass language is\nconsidered acceptable, and for others it represents something fundamentally\nwrong.\nLet's consider a brief example. For emphasis, we often will say \"I'm starving\"\nto communicate that we are quite hungry. Usually this does not literally\nimply that we are starving. Thus, we can conclude that words have different\nlevels of acceptability depending on context and company.\nLet's make this a bit more specific to the problem. I'm sure those reading\nthis are already aware of some common exceptions that fly in spite of the PEO\nupholding a promise to pursue legal action. Common examples include audio engineers\n(sometimes known as producers), combat engineers, and locomotive engineers.\nNone of these positions require you to be a Professional Engineer. Perhaps there are\nsome benefits for being a combat engineer in terms of CAF payscale, but it is\nnot a requirement of the position to be formally a professional engineer.\nThe core argument\nI don't see it reasonable to try to argue that really any sort of engineering student\nis incapable of doing immense hard. Even a software engineer is capable of immense\nevil through rootkits, spyware, and malicious code. Frankly, SWE jobs probably do\ncause the most damage to broader society, seeing as though they're implementing things\nthat are used by a massive group of people.\nThat said, it's worth understanding that tech generally doesn't have strong morals\nand the requirement to actually follow ethical guidelines would likely not bode well\nfor actually being able to be emplyoyed in the software engineering field in general.\nTech already resists censorship and regulation in subtle ways, so creating a class\nof people who are legally required to exercise professional judgement is fundamentally\na poor idea from perspective of employment.\nNow, as for the actual situation, the number of people who graduated ECE in 2022 who are\ncertain that they will pursue a P.Eng post graduation are roughly 5% of respondents.\nIt's not even particularly unreasonable given the job market widely having no interest\nin software developers possessing a P.Eng. A simple search on LinkedIn, Indeed, or Google\nproves that there are copius amounts of \"Software Engineer\" jobs that require no\nengineering degree, much less an actual P.Eng.\nThe truth of the matter is that it's perhaps not accurate to describe the average developer.\nEngineering is somewhat cheapened when used to describe the process of fumbling around\nwith React to design a website. Arguably there's some necessity in engineering being\na precise and mathematical practice that requires understanding what happens at many\ndifferent levels. Consider the civil engineer - they need to understand materials\nchemistry to really be able to make some comment on the state of a structure. The average\n\"software engineer\" is, in reality, not concerned with actual implementation as much as\nhaving something that works. At risk of sounding like a delusional person, consider that\nsimple applications like Visual Studio Code, Slack, or Spotify are so abstracted from the\nhardware that they run inside the Chromium browser but packaged as their own app.\nIn my mind, this is something that we cannot reasonably call engineering.\nNow, with all this thought out of the way, let's get down to the real core of the\nsituation. Regardless of what is technically true, the tech industry will happily\ngobble up delusional perspectives and proudly use them. Look at AR for example. Broadly speaking, AR is an extremely over-hyped part of technology. The idea of spending time and effort to build a system that views the world, does some computation, and then spits out and image on top of it is ridiculous!\nWould it be fun to have an AR world? Sure! Is it at all useful to the point where Google\nshould have been willing to lose what some estimate was over 100 million dollars on? No!\nIf you're finding yourself believing that it was a good use of development given the time,\nconsider all the other common issues with your devices. Would longer batteries have been\na better idea? Perhaps reducing the environmental cost of computation?\nBig tech doesn't care about reality. Big tech is in it to win it - and sometimes that takes\nbreaks in the truth to sound one way on the hopes that it will improve certain qualities.\nI don't see this as fundamentally evil either! Google, Meta, and Apple are all motivated to\ntry to deliver regular profits and the chance of a moonshot.\nSo then, why should we opt to use something less fashionable like \"programmer\" or \"software developer\" when \"software engineer\" is an option? Companies are already willing\nto flout the law without (to my knowledge), almost any intervention by PEO.\nFor those concerned that PEO is going to hunt you down, keep in mind that the majority of\n\"software engineers\" in Canada aren't even working towards an engineering degree. Most of\nthem will have a degree that is ostensibly not engineering and yet they will label\nthemselves a software engineer on their resume.  There's a lot of cases for PEO to get\nbefore they get around to you.\nAfter all, if you're used to the tech grift so far, then why be concerned about a little\nbit of beneficial diction?\n","id":"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/engineering-licensing/","title":"Is the person who drives a train an engineer?"},"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/memory101/":{"body":"Dr. Nullptr\nOr, how I learned to stop worrying and love dynamic memory allocation\nSo, you're an ECE150 student at the University of Waterloo. Maybe you have a bit\nof experience programming, maybe not. Regardless, prepare yourself for some bad\nprogramming habits. Unfortunately, the course seems somewhat rife with\nopportunity to confuse yourself and end up with some pretty bad coding\nmistakes. Worse, even if you manage to do decently in the course, you may still\ncompletely misunderstand how it works.\nThis leads to cargo cult programming, where we worship the idea of setting a\npointer in C++ to nullptr after deleteing it, without really ever knowing\nwhy.\nThe need for this struck me after I found myself trying to clear up what\ndelete in C++ actually does and what memory \"safety\" actually means.\nYou'll certainly hear about \"memory leaks\" or \"segfaults\" in programming\ncourses, but what do they actually refer to? And, more importantly, why are\nthey actually a problem?\nBefore we start, we need to get a few things down. First we need to understand\nwhat the heap and the stack are, what \"scopes\" are in programming, and then\nwhat\nDefinition\nThe heap versus the stack\nWell, here you go again. Sorry to bother you with another explanation of\nsomething that's quite confusing.\nBasically, the stack is a place to temporarily store things. Whenever you\ndeclare a normal variable, you use the stack. The stack exists for each\ndifferent \"scope\" that you go to.\nWoah there, a scope? What's a scope?\nHere's a quick C example that I'll annotate. Notice that it could be compiled\n(turned into computer code) into C++. This is because C++ is mostly C plus\nother things.\n\nOkay! Let's go through this example.\nFirst we declare that we're including stdio.h. All you need to know is that\nthat's the code where printf() is held. We can only print if we include this\nfile. You might ask: why would I need to include something in order to use a\nprint function?  Especially if you've started with Python, where print() is a\npiece of the base language. Basically, it's because C is a simple language.\nThis means it often runs much faster, because it doesn't need to be prepared to\ndo as much as something like Python does.\nNext you'll notice the void keyword. It means that the function g doesn't\ntake anything and doesn't return anything either. Sometimes you'll see people\njust write void g(), but technically this isn't good practice in C, because\nit interprets it as \"you can give me as many arguments as you want!\". Try it\nyourself!\nFrom there, we declare an integer variable a and set it equal to four, declare\nan integer b equal to 3, call the g() function, and then print a out.\nWhen we call g(), we go into the scope of the function g(). The one rule\nabout this is that we can access anything in a \"higher\" scope than the current\none. We don't in my example, but we could totally write printf(\"%d\", b); and\nhave it print out 3. This is because we have all the declared variables from\nearlier here. This is a really important concept (and one that will motivate\nthis post later). We can access anything before it, but writing things inside\nit have no effect when we exit the function call. As soon as we reach the\nend of g(), we go back to main() and lose everything we have inside this\nfunction.\nOkay, wait, we lose it all? I thought we could use functions to do things for us\nand then hand it back?\nYes, yes you can. But not for everything! Only specific things. Some things can\nbe copied trivially. For example, an integer can be returned at the end of a\nfunction, but something like an array cannot (in C and C++). This is because an\narray is a block of memory; not just one individual piece.\nNow that we have lexical scopes down, let's talk about the heap.\nThe heap is the place where we can place things that we want to live until we\ntell them not to. Basically,\nUnfortunately, ECE150 (and from what I know, other courses) don't often put much\nemphasis on what memory usage and safety in C++ actually consists of. I'll\nstart with describing (for a novice, not someone more experienced) how memory\nworks in C, which is a more simple language than C++. If you hear people\ncomplain about C++, it's often because it has a lot of features. Some of\nthese features are good, some of these features are confusing, but most of the\nfeatures have difficulties with compatibility between them.\nIn C, we use a function called malloc to access memory on the heap.\n\nInside of malloc, we pass 5 times the \"sizeof\" an integer in C. This allows us\nto specify how much we want to store in the memory. malloc will actually take\njust the number of bytes you want to store and then give you a pointer to that\nblock of memory.\nThe (int *) tells malloc that we want it to refer to a pointer to an int.\nA quick word about printf\nWhat's that weird %d I see in there? What does that mean?\nGlad you asked! It's a \"character code\", which tells printf how you want to\ndisplay the data. Keep in mind that things like the characters that a computer\nuses to print out \"Hello, World!\" are actually just numbers themselves.\n(They're called ASCII if you use a simple latin character set without accents or other things.) This means that\nsometimes we want to see what number the character corresponds to and therefore\nneed to tell the function whether we want to see it as a character or as a\nnumber. In this case, we're asking for %d, which means \"show me this data as\nan integer number\". Another example would be %f, which means \"show me this\ndata as a floating point number (a number with decimal point like 5.4)\".\nWhat does new do?\nWell, when do I need dynamically allocated things? Great question!\nDynamically allocated memory is useful when dealing with big objects (a large array), that you can't actually copy between places. Theoretically you can just treat it as being on the stack, but this is quite suboptimal due to the size of the stack.\nAnother situation would be for resizing arrays. With statically allocated arrays, such as this char arr[] = \"Hello\";, you cannot resize it even if you want to. However, using dynamic allocation, you can resize using realloc, a function that finds you a new block of memory to store everything and puts the old contents of the memory there.\nKeep in mind that some programming paradigms avoid using the heap (where dynamic memory goes) because of the concern that dynamic allocation is much more likely to cause issues when programming mistakes are made than static allocation.\nYou probably won't need to worry about that style, but NASA does tend to use it.\nWhat does delete actually do?\nDelete in C++ calls the destructor of an object. Sometimes these objects are built in and sometimes they're defined by the programmer. Usually calling delete on them just means that there are objects inside them that need to be freed them.\nNote that if you do not delete your memory, it will be leaked from your process. Due to how operating systems work, once the process (the executable) is finished, the operating system will clean it up for you, but on microcontrollers, it is very likely to just crash if you don't clean it up yourself.\nAlso, if you try to allocate too much at the same time and don't delete any objects you no longer need, you can trivially get yourself an \"OOM\" error. (Out of memory.) Believe me, it's not good and it would make the computer scientists of yesteryear cry.\nA quick word on null and nullptr\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1282295/what-exactly-is-nullptr\nThis is a really useful link for learning the complications with NULL and nullptr. Essentially, nullptr is a whole different type, whereas NULL is just a macro for 0. This means you can use NULL as an argument for a function that takes in an integer. Essentially, always opt to use nullptr in C++, since it is \"type-safe\". In C, it is generally more traditional to use NULL, even though NULL is not actually a whole different type.\n","id":"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/memory101/","title":"Wait, how does memory work again?"},"https://aidenfoxivey.com/blog/replacing-developers/":{"body":"Are developers really going to be replaced by LLMs?\nToday GPT4 has been released. It's looking pretty damn cool. It could apply to\nsome of the top universities in the USA and probably have decent odds of getting\nin. Its performance with the bar is impressive and that's probably not something\nthat's going to regress.\nNaturally, people are back to the classic trend of freaking out when new things\nappear. They're kept at bay by the \"safety measures\"[^1] put in place by the\nengineers working at OpenAI. I think this is probably for good reason. LLMs\ncould make broad swaths of people less employable by outcompeting them. It takes\nless time to review something than it does to create something in the first\nplace. Let's be honest too: a lot of what we say isn't original. LLMs have a\nspecific pattern of speaking, but that pattern of speaking is a weird subset of\nhow humans speak.  There's not that much that just sounds completely strange.\nThe average human communicates with a lot of diction that is just copy-pasted\nfrom another conversation. There's nothing incredibly wrong about this. It's\njust more efficient to take small snippets and put them together. I think people\nwith autism might even have more of an idea about this, given the usage of\nscripting. It's not uncommon to memorize small phrases in order to appear\ncordial or simply get your message across.\nThe concept of replacing programmers starts with the idea that progamming is\nsomething replaceable. This I believe to be somewhat true. There's a lot of\ncruft that could just automatically be generated. Now, people who are eager to\nreplace all their programmers should be rather cautious. Just because you can\nbuy something that \"does it all\" doesn't mean you won't end up spending\nludicrous amounts trying to get it fixed. Part of software development is more\nfor the legal aspect of having a contracting company with responsibility than it\nis actually delivering something. If you have no customer service because you\nhave no devs who actually worked on the project, then you'll soon be cursing the\nfact that you just generated all your code instead of paying someone to write\nit.\nNot to mention, I think this actually ends up opening more options as time goes\non. We started from the perspective of having to write individual machine\ninstructions and eventually worked to the point of being able to tell someone\nthat print(\"Hello, World!\") is all you really need to make your computer do\ncool things. We already have compilers which will take high level code and\ntranslate it to native instructions. This is, to some degree, a blackbox process\nto begin with. Literally blackbox? No. But practically? Yes, of course. LLMs\nhave a long way to go in ensuring they actually do have some aspect of\ndeterministic output. Or at least more predictable output, but I don't see them\nas being much more than another implement used in software development. We\nalready do a tonne of metaprogramming. Introducing LLMs is like metaprogramming\nwith a very inconsistent tool. Not to mention, this is something that will\nlikely develop uses. Maybe small chunks of software can be developed and then\nintegrated. If a software engineer doesn't have to worry about small pieces of\nan API[^2] and can focus at high level orchestration, then maybe that's a\ndecision that has some merit.\nI don't see us actually getting rid of programmers any time soon, but the idea\nthat programmers are \"irreplaceable\" if they keep doing exactly what they're\ndoing now is a little silly.

<p>Long time no chat! Finals season is almost done for me. Just two more exams
and I'll be able to say I'm all done. I can't say I'm super fond of having to
work through finals all that much</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the co-op opportunity that I talked about having in a prior
post has fallen through. I won't get into the specifics, but it was not a
good fit for either of us.</p>
<p>As a result, I applied for the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> and got
in! I'm beyond excited about it and I've also lined up a local startup to
work for during this time. I'm very pleased to have avoided the issue of
employment this term, as it seems to be the trend to not have any good job.</p>
<p>In other news, I've got a blog post in the workings about the CHICKEN Scheme
Compiler. My plan so far for my time at the Recurse Center is to write a
compiler of my own, possibly using Scheme 5 (do people call it that?) as a
target.</p>
<p>Also, I started <a href="https://mastodon.social/@aidenfoxivey/110243666746755004">a chain on Mastodon</a> asking Matt
Godbolt for books on compilers and interpreter design. It has some good picks
out of it. I'll summarize them below for posterity!</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Moden Compiler Construction in ML</em> by Andrew W. Appel</li>
<li><em>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools</em> by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and
Ullman</li>
<li><em>Crafting Interpreters</em> by Robert Nystrom</li>
<li><em>Essentials of Compilation</em> (Python Edition) by Jeremy G. Siek</li>
<li><em>Engineering a Compiler</em> by Cooper and Torczon</li>
</ul>
<p>Not technically a compiler book, but very cool:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Principles of Program Analysis</em> by Nielson, Nielson, and Hankin</li>
</ul>
<p>Some academic resources listed too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stanford's &quot;CS143 Compilers&quot; (by Alex Aiken) on Coursera</li>
<li>Cornell's CS612</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you to Matthew Godbolt, David Beazley, CF Bolz-Tereick, Scott Graham,
Ron Gilbert, sandmage, mnml mnl, Marco, and SteeleDynamics.</p>
